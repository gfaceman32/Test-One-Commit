<h2>Hello Professor Williams.</h2>

This Test Wireframe is a quick mockup using the Golden Ratio calulator. Some basic shapes via illustrator shape tools.
As I am still struggling to understand the nuances of git commands, I must say I enjoy the front end development better
but I am working to get a better grasp of the programmimg side. 

I was curious to whether you'll illustrate how to make our Illustrator mockups web functional?... as I had some trouble 
exporting the file as a HTML document.
